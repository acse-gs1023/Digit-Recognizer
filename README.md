# Digit-Recognizer
Using Mnist Dataset to recognise hand written digits

The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer
We have used CNN and LeNet to predict the test dataset for the hand writted Images.
LeNet is further improved using hyperparameter tuning, to give an accuracy close to 1.
