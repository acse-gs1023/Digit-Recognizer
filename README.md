# Digit Recognizer

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, a classic in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer). It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a handwritten digit.

## Methodology
We employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the LeNet architecture to classify the handwritten digits. The LeNet architecture, a pioneering model in the field of deep learning, has been further improved through hyperparameter tuning to enhance its accuracy.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are a type of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for analyzing visual imagery. They use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing.

### LeNet Architecture
LeNet is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks that helped propel the field of deep learning. In this project, we have optimized the LeNet architecture through hyperparameter tuning, achieving an accuracy close to 1.

## Results
The improved LeNet model demonstrates high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The use of CNNs and careful tuning of the LeNet architecture have been pivotal in achieving these results.
